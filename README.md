Perfect. Here's what we'll do: we‚Äôll build a real-world **Next.js full-stack project** using the **App Router**, **TypeScript**, and a **DDD-inspired modular structure** ‚Äî scalable and production-ready.

### üöÄ Project Scope

Let's assume we‚Äôre building a **"Job Board"** app:

- Users can register/login
- Companies can post jobs
- Job seekers can browse and apply
- Admins can moderate

You can easily adapt this structure later for any app (e.g. eCommerce, SaaS dashboard, etc.)
